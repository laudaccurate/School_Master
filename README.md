# School System

School is a web app where students can register their courses, view their grades and send 
'crude' mails to other users. Leturers can also send mails to all students offering their  courses and also upload academic resources that students can download. There is more to this than is currently available. New ideas and suggestions from other developers and non-developers alike are warmly welcome.
